# Emotion-Detection

Using 1D convolution for detecting emotions from speech. The model is trained in Toronto Dataset, available at https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/24487

All the speech signals were converted to MFCCs, resulting in a vector of 2580. The MFCC coefficients are stored in the full data pickle file.

Dependencies: Python 3.5, Keras 2.0.6, scikit
